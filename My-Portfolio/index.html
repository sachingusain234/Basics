                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>As a third-year college student, I find myself deeply engaged in both academic pursuits and personal growth. With a focus on Computer Science and Engineering, my journey has been enriched by rigorous coursework, stimulating discussions with professors, and collaborative projects with peers. Beyond academics, I actively participate in campus activities and student organizations, contributing to a vibrant campus community. This phase of my college life has not only broadened my knowledge but also nurtured critical thinking skills and a passion for lifelong learning. I look forward to leveraging these experiences as I continue to explore my career aspirations and make meaningful contributions to society.</p>
                <p>Outside of academic responsibilities, I embrace a variety of hobbies that provide balance and relaxation in my busy schedule. Photography has become a creative outlet, allowing me to capture moments on campus and explore different perspectives through the lens. Reading literature from diverse genres offers me a chance to unwind and delve into new worlds of imagination. Additionally, I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and jogging, which not only keep me physically active but also provide moments of reflection amidst nature's beauty. These hobbies not only complement my academic journey but also foster personal well-being and enrich my college experience with memorable moments and new friendships.</p>

                <ion-icon class="icon" name="logo-html5"></ion-icon>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the backbone of web development, providing the structure and content of web pages through a system of tags and attributes. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms, enabling browsers to render these elements into a readable format for users.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <ion-icon class="icon" name="logo-css3"></ion-icon>
                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) complements HTML by controlling the presentation and layout of web pages. It allows developers to define styles such as colors, fonts, margins, and animations, thereby enhancing the visual appeal and usability of websites.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <ion-icon class="icon" name="logo-javascript"></ion-icon>
                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a dynamic programming language that extends the functionality of web pages by enabling interactive features. It runs client-side in web browsers, facilitating actions like form validation, interactive maps, animations, and asynchronous communication with servers. JavaScript's versatility and integration with HTML and CSS make it crucial for creating dynamic and responsive web applications.</p>

            <div>
                <ion-icon class="icon" name="logo-nodejs"></ion-icon>
                <p>Node.js expands JavaScript's capabilities beyond the browser, allowing developers to build server-side applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient for handling concurrent requests. Node.js is commonly used for building scalable network applications, APIs, and real-time applications like chat servers.</p>

            <div>
                <ion-icon class="icon" name="logo-react"></ion-icon>
                <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It enables developers to create reusable UI components that manage their state independently. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for efficient updating of the UI, providing a fast and responsive user experience. It's widely adopted for building single-page applications (SPAs) and is known for its declarative approach and component-based architecture.</p>

                <ion-icon class="icon" name="logo-python"></ion-icon>
                <p>Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It has gained widespread popularity for its clean syntax, making it accessible for beginners and efficient for experienced developers alike. Python excels in web development with frameworks like Django and Flask, which streamline building robust applications. In data science and machine learning, Python's rich ecosystem of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn supports advanced analytics and AI applications.</p>
